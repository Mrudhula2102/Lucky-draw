## Quick Database Check

If login fails, verify in Supabase:

1. Go to **Supabase Dashboard**
2. Navigate to **Database** → **Tables** → **admins**
3. Find your test admin
4. Check the `password_hash` column matches what you entered

**SQL Query:**
```sql
SELECT admin_id, name, email, password_hash, role 
FROM admins 
WHERE email = 'test@example.com';
```

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| No console logs appear | Open DevTools (F12) and refresh |
| Admin not in database | Check for errors during creation |
| Password doesn't match | Check for extra spaces or characters |
| Login still fails | See `ADMIN_LOGIN_FIX.md` for detailed debugging |

---

## What Was Fixed?

✅ **Input Trimming** - Removes whitespace from email/password
✅ **Console Logging** - Shows detailed authentication steps
✅ **Consistent Data** - Same format for storage and comparison

## Next Steps After Testing

1. ✅ Create your actual admin accounts
2. ✅ Test with different roles (ADMIN, MODERATOR)
3. ✅ Review `ADMIN_LOGIN_FIX.md` for production security

If test fails:
1. ❌ Check console logs for specific error
2. ❌ Verify database entry
